Hello CS50

My Project is the famous breakout game . i programmed it using lua and love2d .
I have implemented a map which prints the bricks to the map , a ball and a paddle . when the ball hits a brick , it 
reflects back depending on the side of the brick that was hit and the brick disappears . When the ball hits all of the 
bricks its a 'Victory' state .On the other hand when all 5 hearts are used , then it's a 'Loss' state , in which a
message is prited on the screen stating the current score.
