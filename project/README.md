Hello CS50

My project is the famous Breakout game .I programmed it using lua and love2d .
I have implemented a map , which renders the bricks to the map , a ball and a paddle .When the ball hits a brick ,it 
reflects back of the brick that was hit and the brick disappears . When the ball hits all of the 
bricks its a 'Victory' state .On the other hand when all 5 hearts are used , then it's a 'Loss' state , in which a
message is printed on the screen stating the current score.
