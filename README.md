There are many great communities for support and help, such as [CS50 Stack Exchange](https://cs50.stackexchange.com/), the [CS50 Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cs50/) and the [CS50 Slack](http://cs50.edx.org/slack) to name a few. Investing your time and energy into solving each and every problem set indepdently is the best way to experience the course and the only way to eventual mastery.
